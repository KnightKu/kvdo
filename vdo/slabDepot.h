/**
 * A slab_depot is responsible for managing all of the slabs and block
 * allocators of a VDO. It has a single array of slabs in order to eliminate
 * the need for additional math in order to compute which physical zone a PBN
 * is in. It also has a block_allocator per zone.
 *
 * Load operations are required to be performed on a single thread. Normal
 * operations are assumed to be performed in the appropriate zone. Allocations
 * and reference count updates must be done from the thread of their physical
 * zone. Requests to commit slab journal tail blocks from the recovery journal
 * must be done on the journal zone thread. Save operations are required to be
 * launched from the same thread as the original load operation.
