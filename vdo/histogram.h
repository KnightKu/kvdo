/**
 * Allocate and initialize a histogram that uses linearly sized buckets.
 *
 * The histogram label reported via /sys is constructed from several
 * of the values passed here; it will be something like "Init Label
 * Histogram - number of counted_items grouped by metric
 * (sample_units)", e.g., "Flush Forwarding Histogram - number of
 * flushes grouped by latency (milliseconds)". Thus counted_items and
 * sample_units should be plural.
 *
 * The sampleUnits string will also be reported separately via another
 * /sys entry to aid in programmatic processing of the results, so the
 * strings used should be consistent (e.g., always "milliseconds" and
 * not "ms" for milliseconds).
 *
 * @param parent        The parent kobject.
 * @param name          The short name of the histogram.  This label is used
 *                      for the sysfs node.
 * @param init_label    The label for the sampled data.  This label is used
 *                      when we plot the data.
 * @param counted_items A name (plural) for the things being counted.
 * @param metric        The measure being used to divide samples into buckets.
 * @param sample_units  The unit (plural) for the metric, or NULL if it's a
 *                      simple counter.
 * @param size          The number of buckets.  There are buckets for every
 *                      value from 0 up to size (but not including) size.
 *                      There is an extra bucket for larger samples.
