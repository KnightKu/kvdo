 * fill a compressed block. The input bins are kept in a ring sorted by the
 * amount of unused space so the first bin with enough space to hold a
 * newly-compressed data_vio can easily be found. When the bin fills up or is
 * flushed, the incoming data_vios are moved to the packer's batched_data_vios
 * queue, from which they will eventually be routed to an idle output_bin.
 *
 * There is one special input bin which is used to hold data_vios which have
 * been canceled and removed from their input bin by the packer. These
 * data_vios need to wait for the canceller to rendezvous with them (VDO-2809)
 * and so they sit in this special bin.
